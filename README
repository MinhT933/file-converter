## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
2. Install Go Dependencies
``bash
go mod tidy
🛠️ Running Locally
Run the HTTP/WebSocket Server
bash
make run-server
This runs cmd/server/main.go.

Run the Background Worker
bash
make run-worker
This runs cmd/worker/main.go.

🧱 Building Binaries
To build static binaries into the ./bin directory:

bash
make build-server
make build-worker
To execute:

bash
./bin/server
./bin/worker
🔧 Clean up build artifacts:
bash
make clean
🐳 Running with Docker
If you prefer Docker:

Run the API Server:
bash
docker-compose run --service-ports app
Run the Worker:
bash
docker-compose run --service-ports worker
ℹ️ Make sure supporting services (e.g., Redis, Postgres) are already running with docker-compose up -d.

🔑 Certificate Management (HTTPS/TLS)
Development (auto-generate certs inside image):
bash
docker build --build-arg GENERATE_CERT=true -t file-converter .
Production (mount certs from host):
bash
docker build --build-arg GENERATE_CERT=false -t file-converter .
Then run with:

bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ${PWD}/127.0.0.1.pem:/app/127.0.0.1.pem \
  -v ${PWD}/127.0.0.1-key.pem:/app/127.0.0.1-key.pem \
  file-converter
On Windows CMD, replace ${PWD} with %cd%.

🧪 Running Tests
