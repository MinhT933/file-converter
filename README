# 🧠 Golang Service - Server & Worker

This is a monorepo Go service with two main components:

- 🌐 `cmd/server`: the HTTP/WebSocket server
- ⚙️ `cmd/worker`: the background job processor (e.g., consuming from queue)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2. Install Go dependencies

```bash
go mod tidy
```

---

## 🛠️ Run Locally

### 👉 Run Server

```bash
make run-server
```

Runs `cmd/server/main.go`

### 👉 Run Worker

```bash
make run-worker
```

Runs `cmd/worker/main.go`

---

## 🧱 Build Binaries

Build static binaries into `./bin`:

```bash
make build-server
make build-worker
```

You can run them with:

```bash
./bin/server
./bin/worker
```

---

## 🧹 Clean Build Artifacts

```bash
make clean
```

---

## 🐳 Run with Docker (Optional)

If you use Docker, just run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Or for detached mode:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 🔑 Certificate Generation (for HTTPS/TLS)

- **Dev:**  
  Tự động tạo certificate khi build image:
  ```bash
  docker build --build-arg GENERATE_CERT=true -t file-converter .
  ```

- **Prod:**  
  Không tạo certificate, bạn nên mount file cert/key từ ngoài vào container:
  ```bash
  docker build --build-arg GENERATE_CERT=false -t file-converter .
  ```
